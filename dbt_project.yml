## To start working with dbt views in SDX, please copy this template folder and rename it as per your needs
## Then replace placeholders:
## <<YOUR-PROJECT-NAME>>, <<YOUR-MODEL-NAME>> and <<DREMIO-FOLDER-PATH>> if required
## Also in profiles.yml placeholders should be updated.
## Once done, you can start creating your models as per the README file.

# Name your project! Project names should contain only lowercase characters
# and underscores. A good package name should reflect your organization's
# name or the intended use of these models

# This setting configures which "profile" dbt uses for this project.

# These configurations specify where dbt should look for different types of files.
# The `model-paths` config, for example, states that models in this project can be
# found in the "models/" directory. You probably won't need to change these!

# In this example config, we tell dbt to build all models in the example/
